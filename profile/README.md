# Welcome to our GitHub Page ðŸ‘‹

We're a dynamic team dedicated to creating innovative software solutions. We work in the exciting and fast-paced realm of digital advertising, and we're thrilled to work with [GoComply.ai](https://www.gocomply.ai) and its product ComplyAi.

## About ComplyAi

ComplyAi is a game-changing solution dedicated to empowering businesses in the digital advertising space. By streamlining the ad review process and promoting a compliant and user-friendly environment, ComplyAi aims to simplify digital advertising and make it accessible to all, resulting in increased revenue, optimized ad campaigns, mitigated risk, and an enhanced customer experience.

This AI-driven, patent-pending tool, developed by Meta alumni, provides transparency and detailed guidance to advertisers of all sizes. It helps businesses stay compliant with Metaâ€™s Advertising Policies and Community Standards, along with other regulations like FINRA, ADA, FDA, SEC, or GDPR.

### How It Works

1. **Subscribe**: Advertisers can upload ad content via a self-serve portal.
2. **Automate**: Automated technology and machine learning review ads and reveal compliance errors.
3. **Educate**: The platform shares details on ads for successful campaigns based on the results of autonomous ad reviews.
4. **Launch**: High-performing ads can be deployed into your preferred ad delivery system.

In addition to these steps, ComplyAi offers actionable insights on your business model, creatives, concepts, and elements to inform your creative direction and campaign strategy. They also provide easy resubmission of edited ads for quick and easy approvals and ongoing enforcement to stay up to date with new standards in ad policy.
We're excited about the possibilities that our work with GoComply's ComplyAi can unlock. If you're interested in what we're doing or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out to us!
